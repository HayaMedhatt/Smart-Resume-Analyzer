Named entities are specific types of entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more.\n","\n","### **How NER Works:**\n","\n","1. **Tokenization:** The text is split into individual words or tokens.\n","2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS):** Each token is assigned a part-of-speech tag (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).\n","3. **Named Entity Classification:** Tokens are classified into predefined categories such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DATE, etc.\n","4. **Sequence Labeling:** The boundaries of named entities are identified and labeled within the text.\n","\n","### **Example:**\n","\n","Consider the sentence: \"Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino, California.\"\n","\n","- NER would identify \"Apple Inc.\" as an ORGANIZATION entity and \"Cupertino, California\" as a LOCATION entity.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Training Process for NER üéì\n","\n","Training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model involves teaching the model to recognize and classify named entities in text data. This process typically consists of the following steps:\n","\n","### **1. Data Collection:**\n","Gather a large corpus of annotated text data where named entities are labeled with their corresponding categories (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION).\n","\n","### **2. Data Preprocessing:**\n","Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and labeling named entities.\n","\n","### **3. Model Selection:**\n","Choose an appropriate NER model architecture such as spaCy's pre-trained models (e.g., \"en_core_web_sm\") or train a custom NER model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n","\n","### **4. Training:**\n","Train the NER model on the annotated text data using techniques like supervised learning. During training, the model learns to predict the correct labels for named entities based on the input features (e.g., word embeddings, context information).\n","\n","### **5. Evaluation:**\n","Assess the performance of the trained NER model using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its accuracy and generalization ability.\n","\n","### **6. Deployment:**\n","Deploy the trained NER model for real-world applications such as information extraction, document summarization, and question answering systems.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Conclusion üöÄ\n","\n","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in NLP that plays a crucial role in various applications, including information extraction, entity linking, and semantic search. By accurately identifying named entities in text data, NER enables machines to understand and analyze human language more effectively, leading to smarter and more efficient natural language processing systems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# NER training function"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load blank model\n","nlp = spacy.blank('en')\n","\n","def train_model(train_data):\n","    if 'ner' not in nlp.pipe_names:\n","        # Add the NER pipeline to the NLP model by name\n","        nlp.add_pipe('ner', last=True)\n","    \n","    # Get the NER component from the pipeline\n","    ner = nlp.get_pipe('ner')\n","\n","    # Add labels to the NER pipeline\n","    for _, annotations in train_data:\n","        for ent in annotations.get('entities'):\n","            ner.add_label(ent[2])\n","    \n","    # Remove other pipelines if they exist\n","    other_pipes = [pipe for pipe in nlp.pipe_names if pipe != 'ner']\n","    with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes):  # Only train NER\n","        optimizer = nlp.begin_training()\n","        for itn in range(10):  # Train for 10 iterations\n","            print(\"Starting iteration \" + str(itn))\n","            random.shuffle(train_data)\n","            losses = {}\n","            for i, (text, annotations) in enumerate(train_data, 1):\n","                try:\n","                    # Create an Example object for each training instance\n","                    doc = nlp.make_doc(text)\n","                    example = Example.from_dict(doc, annotations)\n","                    # Update the model with the Example object\n","                    nlp.update(\n","                        [example],  # Batch of Example objects\n","                        drop=0.2,  # Dropout - make it harder to memorize data\n","                        sgd=optimizer,  # Callable to update weights\n","                        losses=losses)\n","                except Exception as e:\n","                    if \"conflicting doc.ents\" in str(e):\n","                        #print(f\"Error updating model in document {i}: {e}\")\n","                        continue\n","                    else:\n","                        #print(f\"Error updating model in document {i}: {e}\")\n","                        continue\n","                \n","            print(losses)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# First NER model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Loading the dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Format of the first item: <class 'tuple'>\n","First item: ('Govardhana K Senior Software Engineer  Bengaluru, Karnataka, Karnataka - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Govardhana-K/ b2de315d95905b68  Total IT experience 5 Years 6 Months Cloud Lending Solutions INC 4 Month ‚Ä¢ Salesforce Developer Oracle 5 Years 2 Month ‚Ä¢ Core Java Developer Languages Core Java, Go Lang Oracle PL-SQL programming, Sales Force Developer with APEX.
